# Reddit Flair Detection

This is an independent project to learn deep learning techniques in NLP.

Experimented by training posts from a subreddit with LSTM, CNN, ANN models to detect the flair of a post and also compared results with linear models as well.
Used fastText, Word2Vec and TF-IDF vectorizers for creating embeddings. Also built a web application on Django to identify the flair of a post for a link entered by user.
